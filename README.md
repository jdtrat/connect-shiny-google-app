This repository is an accompaniment to my blog post ['Connecting Shiny with Google Drive and Google Sheets'](https://jdtrat.com/blog/connect-shiny-google/).

It contains the code for a simple survey app hosted on RStudio's platform, [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io), created with my package [shinysurveys](https://shinysurveys.jdtrat.com/). Respondent data gets stored in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TF2MRzN04jmgiR9o5YSuL5KV8nTV2v4lSmZzNpPFNN4/edit?usp=sharing).

Note: the code in this app differs from the original blog post only in my adding a disclaimer that data is stored on Google Sheets and I've added a confirmation modal.
